Okay, let's break down the `decoder.py` and `decode_layer.py` files, explaining the code line by line and how they work together.

**decoder.py**

This file defines the `Decoder` module, which is a crucial part of a Transformer model for sequence generation.  It takes the encoded input (memory) from the encoder and generates the output sequence.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

from model.decode_layer import DecoderLayer
from model.positional_encoding import PositionalEncoding


class Decoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model, n_layers, n_heads, d_ff, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)
        self.pos = PositionalEncoding(d_model)
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([DecoderLayer(d_model, n_heads, d_ff, dropout) for _ in range(n_layers)])
        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)

    def forward(self, tgt, memory, src_mask=None, tgt_mask=None):
        print("Decoder Forward:")
        print("tgt shape:", tgt.shape)
        print("memory shape:", memory.shape)
        print("src_mask shape:", src_mask.shape if src_mask is not None else "None")
        print("tgt_mask shape:", tgt_mask.shape if tgt_mask is not None else "None")

        x = self.embed(tgt)
        x = self.pos(x)
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x, memory, src_mask=src_mask, tgt_mask=tgt_mask)
        return self.norm(x)
```

*   **`import torch`**: Imports the PyTorch library.
*   **`import torch.nn as nn`**: Imports the neural network module from PyTorch.
*   **`from model.decode_layer import DecoderLayer`**: Imports the `DecoderLayer` module from a local file.  This is the building block of the decoder.
*   **`from model.positional_encoding import PositionalEncoding`**: Imports the `PositionalEncoding` module.  This adds positional information to the input embeddings.
*   **`class Decoder(nn.Module):`**: Defines the `Decoder` class, inheriting from `nn.Module`.
*   **`def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model, n_layers, n_heads, d_ff, dropout=0.1):`**:  The constructor of the `Decoder` class.
    *   `vocab_size`: The size of the vocabulary.
    *   `d_model`: The dimensionality of the embeddings and hidden states.
    *   `n_layers`: The number of decoder layers.
    *   `n_heads`: The number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.
    *   `d_ff`: The dimensionality of the feedforward network.
    *   `dropout`: The dropout rate.
*   **`super().__init__()`**: Calls the constructor of the parent class (`nn.Module`).
*   **`self.embed = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)`**: Creates an embedding layer.  This layer converts input tokens (represented as integers) into dense vectors of size `d_model`.
*   **`self.pos = PositionalEncoding(d_model)`**: Creates a `PositionalEncoding` object.  This adds positional information to the embeddings, which is necessary because the Transformer architecture doesn't have inherent knowledge of the order of the input sequence.
*   **`self.layers = nn.ModuleList([DecoderLayer(d_model, n_heads, d_ff, dropout) for _ in range(n_layers)])`**: Creates a list of `DecoderLayer` objects.  `nn.ModuleList` is used to properly register the layers as part of the `Decoder` module so that their parameters are learned during training.  The number of layers is determined by `n_layers`.
*   **`self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)`**: Creates a layer normalization layer.  Layer normalization helps to stabilize training and improve performance.
*   **`def forward(self, tgt, memory, src_mask=None, tgt_mask=None):`**: Defines the forward pass of the decoder.
    *   `tgt`: The target sequence (input to the decoder).  This is the sequence that the decoder is trying to predict.
    *   `memory`: The output from the encoder.  This contains the encoded information about the source sequence.
    *   `src_mask`: A mask for the source sequence.  This is used to prevent the decoder from attending to padding tokens in the source sequence.
    *   `tgt_mask`: A mask for the target sequence.  This is used to prevent the decoder from "cheating" by attending to future tokens in the target sequence during training (causal masking).
*   **`print("Decoder Forward:")`**: Prints a message indicating that the forward pass of the decoder is being executed.
*   **`print("tgt shape:", tgt.shape)`**: Prints the shape of the target sequence tensor.

*   **`print("src_mask shape:", src_mask.shape if src_mask is not None else "None")`**: Prints the shape of the source mask tensor, or "None" if it's not provided.
*   **`print("tgt_mask shape:", tgt_mask.shape if tgt_mask is not None else "None")`**: Prints the shape of the target mask tensor, or "None" if it's not provided.
*   **`x = self.embed(tgt)`**: Embeds the target sequence using the embedding layer.
*   **`x = self.pos(x)`**: Adds positional encodings to the embedded target sequence.
*   **`for layer in self.layers:`**: Iterates through the decoder layers.
    *   **`x = layer(x, memory, src_mask=src_mask, tgt_mask=tgt_mask)`**: Passes the input `x` (along with the memory, source mask, and target mask) through each decoder layer.  The output of each layer becomes the input to the next layer.
*   **`return self.norm(x)`**: Applies layer normalization to the final output and returns it.

**decode_layer.py**

This file defines the `DecoderLayer` module, which is the fundamental building block of the `Decoder`. Each `DecoderLayer` consists of self-attention, cross-attention (attention over the encoder output), and a feedforward network.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

from model.feedforward import FeedForward
from model.multihead_attention import MultiHeadAttention


class DecoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, n_heads, d_ff, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attn = MultiHeadAttention(d_model, n_heads)
        self.cross_attn = MultiHeadAttention(d_model, n_heads)
        self.ff = FeedForward(d_model, d_ff, dropout)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.norm3 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, tgt, memory, src_mask=None, tgt_mask=None):
        print("DecoderLayer Forward:")
        print("tgt shape:", tgt.shape)
        print("memory shape:", memory.shape)
        print("src_mask shape:", src_mask.shape if src_mask is not None else "None")
        print("tgt_mask shape:", tgt_mask.shape if tgt_mask is not None else "None")

        # Self-attention
        x = self.norm1(tgt)
        x = tgt + self.dropout(self.self_attn(x, x, x, mask=tgt_mask))

        # Cross-attention
        x = self.norm2(x)
        x = x + self.dropout(self.cross_attn(x, memory, memory, mask=src_mask))

        # Feed forward
        x = self.norm3(x)
        x = x + self.dropout(self.ff(x))
        return x

In summary, the `Decoder` consists of multiple `DecoderLayer` blocks. Each `DecoderLayer` performs self-attention on the target sequence, cross-attention on the encoder's output, and applies a feedforward network.  Residual connections and layer normalization are used to improve training stability and performance.  The target mask prevents the decoder from "cheating" during training, and the source mask prevents the decoder from attending to padding tokens in the source sequence.
