**1. `transformer.py` calling `encoder.py`**

In `transformer.py`, the `Transformer` class instantiates an `Encoder` object within its `__init__` method:

```python
self.encoder = Encoder(src_vocab_size, d_model, n_layers, n_heads, d_ff, dropout)
```

Here's what each parameter means:

*   `src_vocab_size`: The size of the source vocabulary. This determines the number of unique words/tokens in the input language.
*   `d_model`: The dimensionality of the model's embeddings and hidden states.  This represents the "width" of the transformer network.
*   `n_layers`: The number of encoder layers stacked on top of each other.  More layers allow the model to learn more complex relationships in the data.
*   `n_heads`: The number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.  This allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence in parallel.
*   `d_ff`: The dimensionality of the feedforward network within each encoder layer.  This is typically larger than `d_model` to provide more capacity for learning.
*   `dropout`: The dropout rate used for regularization.  This helps prevent overfitting.

The `Transformer`'s `forward` method then calls the encoder's `forward` method:

```python
memory = self.encoder(src, src_mask)
```

*   `src`: The input sequence of source tokens (represented as numerical indices).
*   `src_mask`: An optional mask that indicates which tokens in the source sequence should be ignored (e.g., padding tokens).

The output of the encoder, `memory`, represents the encoded representation of the source sequence, which is then passed to the decoder.

**2. `encoder.py` and `encoder_layer.py` working together**

The `Encoder` class in `encoder.py` is responsible for encoding the input sequence into a context-aware representation. It does this by:

1.  **Embedding:** Converting the input tokens into dense vectors using `nn.Embedding`.
2.  **Positional Encoding:** Adding positional information to the embeddings using `PositionalEncoding` so the model can understand the order of the tokens in the sequence.
3.  **Stacking Encoder Layers:** Passing the embedded and positionally encoded input through a stack of `EncoderLayer` objects.  This is the core of the encoding process.
4.  **Normalization:** Applying layer normalization (`nn.LayerNorm`) to the final output.

The `EncoderLayer` class in `encoder_layer.py` represents a single layer in the encoder stack. Each `EncoderLayer` performs the following operations:

1.  **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Applies multi-head self-attention to the input sequence. This allows the layer to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture relationships between tokens.  The parameters are:
    *   `d_model`: The input and output dimensionality.
    *   `n_heads`: The number of attention heads.
2.  **Feed Forward Network:** Applies a feedforward network to each token's representation. This adds non-linearity to the model and allows it to learn more complex features. The parameters are:
    *   `d_model`: The input and output dimensionality.
    *   `d_ff`: The dimensionality of the hidden layer in the feedforward network.
    *   `dropout`: The dropout rate.
3.  **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:**  Applies residual connections and layer normalization around both the multi-head attention and feedforward network.  This helps to stabilize training and improve performance.
4.  **Dropout:** Applies dropout for regularization.

**In summary:**

The `Encoder` orchestrates the encoding process by embedding the input, adding positional information, and passing the data through a stack of `EncoderLayer`s. Each `EncoderLayer` refines the representation by applying multi-head self-attention and a feedforward network, along with residual connections and layer normalization. The parameters used in these layers control the model's capacity, attention mechanism, and regularization.
